For this assignment, we perform classification tasks using two different datasets in WEKA using Explorer and Experimenter. The classificaiton methods used including follows:

- OneR
- Naive Bayes
- J48
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Randome Forest


## Dataset
contact-lenses.arff and iris.arff

## Results
- 'RawResults.csv' is generated from WEKA Experimenter using a contact-lenses dataset.
- 'Results_Assignment_4.xlsx' is created to summarize the results of three runs from Explorer - Use training set, Crossvaliation with 10 folds, and Percentage split (set to 66%). Moreover, from the Experimenter using cross-validation. 
- 'explorer-contact-lenses' and 'explorer-iris' folders include all WEKA output in TEXT format.
- 'Zhang_Zhang_Enersen_Anderson.pdf' is included in the zip file.
